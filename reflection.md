# Reflection doc

## Time spent on each section

- Task 1 : I need 5 days to make progress on task 1, as I didn't spend the whole day on the task and caught a flu.
- Task 2 : 5 days. Day 1 : understand problem and which tools to use. Day 2 : set up workflow. Day 3/4 : keep on going and refine. Day 5 : clean up.

## Perceived difficulty

- Task 1
   - EDA : easy - medium, because it needed fair and sound understanding of biological data processing. It was a bit hard to grasp without domain knowledge on data but it comes with practise and reading.
   - Data processing & discriminatory analysis : easy
- Task 2 Medium - Hard

## What worked well

* Task 1 EDA, classification and feature importance retrieval
* Task 2 : find the right models to use for the task

## Challenges encountered : how I addressed them

* It was hard at first to get meaningful biological insights for clever data processing during EDA : I solved it by looking up more information on LC/MS data processing and caveats with publications.
* I needed for a GPU for task 2 : I did my setup on colab notebooks
* Find a meaningful way to enrich the list of "discovered glycans" based on embeddings : try out clustering and closest neighbours finding. 
* I couldn't complete some tasks I planned since I went too much into the details.

## Feedback on the assignment structure

* Clear instructions and helpful hints.
* Sufficient documentation provided.
* Presenting glycowork library was a big hint for task 2 direction, I may have lacked of creativity thus.
