# Reflection doc

## Time spent on each section:

- Task 1 : I need 5 days to make progress on task 1, as I didn't spend the whole day on the task and caught flue 
- Task 2 : under completion

## Perceived difficulty

- Task 1
   - EDA : medium, because it needed fair and sound understanding of biological data processing was a bit hard to grasp without domain knowledge on data but it comes with practise and reading
   - Data processing & discriminatory analysis : easy
- Task 2 Medium - Hard

## What worked well

## Challenges encountered : how I addressed them

* I haven't been coding for a long time : I solved it with some Leetcode exercises and the usage of AI assistant on VS code !
* It was hard at first to get meaningful biological insights for clever data processing during EDA : I solved it by looking up more information on LC/MS data processing and caveats with publications.
* I needed for a GPU on task 2 : set up a colab notebook

I couldn't complete some tasks I planned.
